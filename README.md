Sikuli Java API
===============

Sikuli API for Java provides image-based GUI automation functionalities to Java programmers. It is created and will be actively maintained by Sikuli Lab. The effort of making this API is a response to the desire of many Sikuli users to use Sikuli Script's functionalities directly in their Java programs, rather than writing Jython scripts. This new Java library has a re-designed API and includes several new functions that were not available in the original Sikuli Script, such as the abilities to match colors, handle events, and find geometric patterns such as rectangular buttons. Moreover, it has a greatly simplified build process based on Maven.
